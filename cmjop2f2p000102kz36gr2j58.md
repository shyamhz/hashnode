I am Shyamendra Hazra and I am a Web Developer.

### **"Shyam is a developer who focuses on building clean, fast, and reliable websites and web apps. He works across both frontend and backend, and cares a lot about how things actually run under the hood.**

### **He works mainly on Linux and enjoys building things that feel solid, responsive, and well-engineered rather than flashy or fragile."**

Currently I am learning Full Stack Web Development as Javascript as backend language. Also I love Coding in C, Typescript , PHP and Python.

It is nice to meet you and hopefully we will build a greater and nicer tech ecosystem together. Let’s build tools that scale!
