HTML is the skeleton or core structure of every website on the internet. Without HTML there are not website or web app. HTML or **Hyper Text Markup Language** is the language of the Internet to transfer useful, structured and semantic information.

Today we will understand what it is and how you can write your own HTML webpage.

## HTML tags

Tags are little smaller chunks of an HTML that are written in specific order to make up the whole HTML document. Each and every tag has it’s own individual purpose. Each tag is a wrapper or a box to contain some content or information. Depending how you want to convey or present an information on the screen you chose and appropriate tag for it.

## Tag and Element

If Tag is a wrapper around the content then the whole content wrapped in a tag with all the information and content as a whole is called an Element. A tag is an available wrapper and an element is a content wrapped in a particular tag.

## Common Tags

Below is some of the most commonly used simple tags.

### body

### Paired tags and self closing tags

You may have noticed that some tags like body, h1, p, div are paired they have a opening and closing pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt; , essentially same tag name repeated with a `/` . But some tags like `hr` `br` are self closing , simply they are written once and in the first `<` and `>` they are terminated with an `/` .

## Block level and Inline elements

The element’s like `div` and `p` they contain multiple blocks or elements , like paragraph tag can contain multiple chunks or text or div elements can contains multiple other elements including div elements. So elements made of them are known as block level elements and they take all the available space.

And the other elements like `a` tag elements take only the space needed. These types of elements are knows as Inline elements.

## Conclusion

This is not nearly close to all the available tags and elements available in HTML and are just a small subset. You may go ahead and read more about all the tags available, although that is not recommended. You may refer to [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) or [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for reference.  

Hopefully now you understand basics of HTML and the tags and elements, difference between them, what are Inline and Block elements.
